Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at the University of Washington, Seattle. 
My research examines urban governance, homelessness, and housing inequality in U.S. cities. 
I am currently completing my dissertation, a case study of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA), which explores how local governments in progressive cities navigate tensions between economic growth and social equity.
My work has appeared in [*City and Community*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15356841221140078), [*Annual Review of Sociology*](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-031021-105657), and the [*American Journal of Cultural Sociology*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41290-021-00149-8).
